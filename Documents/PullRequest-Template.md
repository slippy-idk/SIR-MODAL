# PullRequest-Template
Everything below in this template will assit you in how to format pull requests.

## 1. Overview:
Provide a direct overview of what you have done on the pull request. Scale the description based on how complex the issue was, or how many modifcations where made.

## 2. Status:
Please provide a status on your pull request. Either specify if its `ongoing` or `awaiting`. If its `ongoing` its means that the pull request is not completed, and still being added to. This would not be nessesary but we are unable to make draft PR's. And if the pull request is `awaiting`, it is completed and await review.

You only need to specify this once. The matter of which if the PR is still `ongoing` or `awaiting` can be judged by the responses to the PR and the changes can be made accordingly then. You can specify this through making a section in your post about the status or use the labels. Labels would be more benefical. At the end of a PR, a `completed` label will be attached to the PR.

### Note:
This is subject to change.
