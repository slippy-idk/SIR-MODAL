# Branch-Template
Everything below in this template will assit you in how to format templates.

## 1. Name:
Name your branch based of what your working on. You should only dedicate one branch to one fix. This means its easier to keep track of.

## 2. Branch sourcing:
If your branch is sourced from an unmerged branch, the active branch should not be merged to main, instead it should be merged into the unmerged branch, and then the following unmerged branch should be merged to main.

### Note:
This is subject to change.
